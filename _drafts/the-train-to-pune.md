It's 8 o'clock, the bell that calls us for breakfast every day doesn't ring, to avoid waking up the other guests of the residency, but the food is waiting for us, my stomach knows it (Matteo writing here).

The gate squicks, the roar of a white Bolero breaks the silence of the quiet morning of Kamshet's hills. It's Ramdas, the village driver who takes us to the station. Everyone knows that he wasn't born to be a driver, but a pilot.

We are all still half-asleep, but at the front a fast and loud conversation in Marathi goes on, while the car drifts on the wild curves of the narrow roads. Soon we all understand that we are late, we are not going to catch the train at Kamshet station. Plan B is on, we need to take a shorter route to another station, Talegaon, where another train is going to take us in time to Pune.

It's the first train journey in India (for most of us) and the first public toilet experience for Julia. "It was not too bad" she says. Although the sun is up and bright, Niall fears the darkness of the train coaches. Trains in India don't have any light, he was told...

At Pune Shivajinagar Station, we are welcomed by the curiosity of the "Auto" drivers. We squeeze in two of them and the horns go off to free our way towards Sudarshan Rangamanch, where our first workshop of the tour will take place. Only few know that Indian vehicles can't go forwards unless they are constantly honking. It's not an angry honk, it's a simple statement of existence and intention.
