It's 8 o'clock, the bell that calls us for breakfast every day doesn't ring, to avoid waking up the other guests of the residency, but the food is waiting for us, my stomach knows it (Matteo writing here).

The gate squicks, the roar of a white Bolero breaks the silence of the quiet morning of Kamshet's hills. It's Ramdas, the village driver who takes us to the station. Everyone knows that he wasn't born to be a driver, but a pilot.

We are all still half-asleep, but at the front a fast and loud conversation in Marathi goes on, while the car drifts on the wild curves of the narrow roads. Soon we all understand that we are late, we are not going to catch the train at Kamshet station. Plan B is on, we need to take a shorter route to another station, Talegaon, where another train is going to take us in time to Pune.

It's the first train journey in India (for most of us) and the first public toilet experience for Julia. "It was not too bad" she says. Although the sun is up and bright, Niall fears the darkness of the train coaches. Trains in India don't have any light, he was told...

At Pune Shivajinagar Station, we are welcomed by the curiosity of the "Auto" drivers. We squeeze in two of them and the horns go off to free our way towards Sudarshan Rangamanch, where our first workshop of the tour will take place. Only few know that Indian vehicles can't go forwards unless they are constantly honking. It's not an angry honk, it's a simple statement of existence and intention.

A couple of zig zags through overfilled busses, motorcycles and our auto stops in front of [Sudarshan Rangamanch](https://www.facebook.com/MCCsudarshan/), the theatre studios where our workshop will take place. The entrance is in the tight courtyard of one of the buildings that limits the narrow dusty road we just came from. 

In the hour that separates us from the beginning of the workshop the excitement grows as the participants gather in the courtyard. We get told off several times for being too loud whilst some auditions are going on in one of the studios. We gather our 17 participants on the top-floor studio, it's nice spacious and fresh, but a few seconds of us playing games and more complaint come from the auditions studio. We get confined in the basement :-(.

The day goes fast as the enthusiasm of the wonderful people that joined us rushes us through our proposals of play and creation of story through movement. At lunch time Vivek brings us (Niall and Matteo, who were afraid of not being satisfied by our packed lunch) to a very fancy restaurant on the first floor of a building which is being half renovated/built from 0. We just sit in time before a team of agile waiters fills up our plate and bowls with variety of Dahls and Curries and as we eat they keep coming back, like a group of grasshoppers in reverse, who appear from nowhere and disappear nowhere leaving behind all the food the you need for one year. 

The afternoon offers us the opportunity to get to know better the people we are moving and playing with and to launch the next provocation: devising through memory. 

It's been an intense day and our abstinence from beer needs to come to an end. That's how we ended up at the "1000 Oaks", a "European style pub serving North-Indian food", that translates to bright coloured cocktails and commercial remix of western Pop Music indoor and a luxurious looking garden outdoor. 

On the way there, rigorously captained by the black and yellow three wheeler, Julia has the great idea of leaving one of her bags on the auto and just remember once we are all sat at the table. In the time that takes her to say "Shit I forgot the bag", a waiter calls with good news, the driver came back to give back the bag. 

The rest of the evening we don't remember. Our mouths and stomachs where too spiced up, our minds mashed and the chilly train journey kept us awake, although we wanted to sleep so bad...

Sunday feels fresh, Ramdas is again late, or maybe we are, or we planned to be late since being late the day before turned out to be quite alright. The workshop goes faster, the momentum kept the work rolling on itself as the challenges of creation that we threw in the space grew together with the confidence of the participants, towards each other and towards themselves. 

Today the lunch is delivered, and some people brought cake and biscuits and some other people other food to share. "Will they bring spoons with the food? Yeah no?" Asks Ainhoa whilst Vivek adds dishes to the order. "Yes of course" replies the young man. They bring no spoons of course, but for some it's a good occasion to learn eating the Indian way: make a scoop-like shape with 4 fingers of your right hand, collect some of the food with them and shovel it in your mouth using your thumb. Some other don't give up and make spoons out of pappadam and aluminum foil.
