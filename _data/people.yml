  bio: Type Good design is about understanding people. We take a step back before starting a project, taking time to figure out the smart approach, not the easy one. We are experts in our field, have an opinion on our craft, and are ambitious; but always humble, because we know there’s always more to learn. We have the freedom to develop in a direction that is true to us, but also be there for others when they need us; sharing our skills, lending a hand, or reflecting over pizza.
