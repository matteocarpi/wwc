It has been a few days now since we landed in Mumbai and drove through the busy Indian night to reach "The Company Theatre" a theatre residency in [Kamshet](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kamshet,+Maharashtra+410405/@18.7644399,73.5381673,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3bc2abf1867b9187:0x7ec39c03e715fbdb!8m2!3d18.7517777!4d73.5513956). The Jetlag is slowly fading away, but the excitement and gratefulness to be in this place does not seem to leave us. Niall is eating loads, as always, and points out at how much Matteo is eating, as always.

A couple of newspapers wrote an article to introduce our upcoming tour: [Midday Mumbai](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mid-day.com%2Farticles%2Fcurtains-down-on-power-play%2F20188164%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3Tq4WYxacFDOzfcj62s_JH5wCj34x0BYO-BJy4ajrwMkaZe2D8DWu2WQ4&h=AT2oAqEJ60K1cSB1bUPXBAWjCRHyxCiG1rc67Sk0ZFVU6hAoi5_i4v2PhdtPTojZAx6ze5o5dCdX5Vh_cWbHdGR3hAVLuPMhBD3cjEy_IIv-zcvdJAnNYDsaA4yUYBgLEAbpkwfF24YM1kIrgBWNFAJowx4a7L-YIZChuPMIPmikLogvFrvl5IduNhiYmwrSJlAS3lT9WkI1QoSwlh9KPO9mvwH89WrNrrXIxYtnxpXzPt_AU8SSvS2xw989oqhf1wn3Zx4nrWx3gm8Q4WZM4tj20mdeG-8b9Py7VO7DG14dNXM2OmwFTZC_BBcrBElKn5dMvi_ZK8VwTdhbt9nPAw5EVw_Ltx7-En1O3jQLeifkTfS_dMkf6fmi6HPuguG5-cdGrSdO2u0otJr6f4mTd83ZInyb88WqU_IYMKaSohcx8YhdWV6x82Z2baK3NNs9MQAEo4d2pu6s5Eros98Y4sqnlLkRoNPhyt972hKhmNd0O140qsWYyNiLZ-8QGrJlSH8d1vuk8oMfxma3VW6j-4RyqXvqsEQU3PPQ7U0UcQvgVxRGsSzcYieZ8QSw5z-fWF9n-pPf8fkf8hQQQ7GF0-AIiFrpvNjtCJ7dZcs-0LSfgr-B-0D4pXUUgWkMFIwtEcFmdNJrvqo), [Pune Mirror](https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/unwind/a-collaborative-tour-de-force/articleshow/67443848.cms?fbclid=IwAR2Sirp1dbMcyio-F6eynJaGR4_S8sVeAvbNdfeWTkdncpNx4bCenk3KzQo "Pune Mirror").
