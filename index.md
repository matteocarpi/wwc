biography: "\n\nThe program of work is conceived by the seven international artists
  who originate from Austria, England, Italy, Spain and India. They met during their
  training at The London International School of Performing Arts, a school now based
  Berlin and well-known for its unique training on Jacques Lecoq’s pedagogy.\n\nThe
  Whilst Walking Collective is an international group of theatre makers who create
  performances and workshops around the world. Their unique process and style has
  given them cross-continental success through touring and teaching devised theatre.
  \n\n“Writing with the whole body, not just with the pen”.\n\nThe collective was
  born \n\nThe work of the collective thrives by working side-by-side with the new
  generation, facilitating the participant’s unique charisma and evoking their capacity
  to dream. By having a focus on group creation, we merge individual expression with
  thought-provoking and accessible productions. The members of the collective have
  been teaching workshops for over a decade, inspiring (and being inspired by) participants
  who develop our artistic practice. Our work often combines physical comedy, tragedy,
  personal storytelling, and even multimedia. \n"
