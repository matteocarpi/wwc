biography: "\nThe Whilst Walking Collective is an international group of theatre-makers
  who create performances and workshops around the world. Their unique process and
  style have given them cross-continental success through touring and teaching devised
  theatre. \n\nThe seven artists originate from Austria, England, Italy, Spain and
  India. They met during their training at The London International School of Performing
  Arts, a school now based Berlin (as Arthaus.Berlin) and well-known for its unique
  training on Jacques Lecoq’s pedagogy.\n\nThe work of the collective thrives by working
  side-by-side with the new generation, facilitating workshops to evoke the participant’s
  unique charisma and evoking their capacity to dream. By having a focus on group
  creation, we merge individual expression with thought-provoking and accessible productions.
  The members of the collective have been teaching workshops for over a decade, inspiring
  (and being inspired by) participants who develop our artistic practice. Our work
  often combines physical comedy, tragedy, personal storytelling, and even multimedia.
