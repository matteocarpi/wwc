about_the_tour: "The Showcase is informed and inspired by the performerâ€™s contemporary
  European contexts, alongside myths and the personal stories of the creators. The
  collective is for the first time present in front of Indian audiences exploring
  the universal appeal of creation methods.  \n  \nThe festival will offer Workshops
  exploring the devising process used by the collective. But like with every devising
  group, the collective has a way of working that is malleable and welcoming to the
  participation of new members. This is a way for the group to share their methods
  of theatrical creation with young to mid-career artistes across India to evolve
  their shared performance vocabulary."
