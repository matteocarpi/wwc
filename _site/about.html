  <p>Type Good design is about understanding people. We take a step back before starting a project, taking time to figure out the smart approach, not the easy one. We are experts in our field, have an opinion on our craft, and are ambitious; but always humble, because we know there’s always more to learn. We have the freedom to develop in a direction that is true to us, but also be there for others when they need us; sharing our skills, lending a hand, or reflecting over pizza.</p>

  The Whilst Walking Theatre Festival includes performances, theatrical experiments, and workshops, all pointing towards their unique use of a Theatre Lab setting.

  The Showcase is informed and inspired by the performer’s contemporary European contexts, alongside myths and the personal stories of the creators. The collective is for the first time present in front of Indian audiences exploring the universal appeal of creation methods.

  At the heart of the work is an exploration of physical ensemble in performance. By using the body as a physical tool for creation, they explore the idea of a collective unconscious. In connection with their training, they are a group that searches for organic, historical and mythical means of communication through the body in theatre.

  By being in a foreign context, the showcase becomes an intercultural exchange, inviting precise feedback that will develop the company’s strategies to question the function of performance worldwide.

  The festival will offer Workshops exploring the devising process used by the collective. But like with every devising group, the collective has a way of working that is malleable and welcoming to the participation of new members. This is a way for the group to share their methods of theatrical creation with young to mid-career artistes across India to evolve their shared performance vocabulary.

  The collective hopes that the exchanges with participants along the way will subsequently develop even the work that we present in each respective city.
