    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
<hr>
<p>We draw you into our story, a seamless extension of your own. We aren’t only curious about design, but about our users, our peers, and our clients. We are united in our determination to create meaningful change, taking pride in making long-lasting impact. Be passionately curious.</p>

  <h4>Ainhoa Hevia Uria</h4>
  <p>Type Good design is about understanding people. We take a step back before starting a project, taking time to figure out the smart approach, not the easy one. We are experts in our field, have an opinion on our craft, and are ambitious; but always humble, because we know there’s always more to learn. We have the freedom to develop in a direction that is true to us, but also be there for others when they need us; sharing our skills, lending a hand, or reflecting over pizza.</p>
